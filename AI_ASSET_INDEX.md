# AI Asset Index

**Canonical machine-readable search index:** `catalog/MASTER_ASSET_INDEX.json`

**Crawler-friendly table:** `catalog/MASTER_ASSET_INDEX.csv`

**Crawler entrypoint:** `CRAWLER_ENTRYPOINT.md`

This repository is the master reusable game-asset library.

## How AI models should use this repository
1. Search this file first by **asset type**, **theme**, **format**, or **gameplay role**.
2. Prefer packs marked **STORED**. These are owned copies in this repository's GitHub Releases.
3. Use source URLs only for provenance/licence verification, never as the primary asset location.
4. Before reusing an asset outside a game project, check the bundled licence in the pack.
5. For engine import, prefer GLB/glTF where available, then FBX, then OBJ for static meshes.

## File naming convention
Pack names are intentionally descriptive and stable. AI agents should select the smallest relevant pack rather than unpacking the entire library.

## Engine guidance
**Unity:** FBX or GLB/glTF -> Assets/; use Humanoid rig where appropriate.
**Unreal Engine:** FBX -> Skeletal Mesh / Static Mesh; preserve skeleton and animation files.
**Godot:** GLB/glTF preferred; import scenes and AnimationPlayer/AnimationTree content.
**Web/Three.js:** GLB/glTF preferred; PNG/WebP for 2D and backgrounds.

## Licence rule
The repository stores reusable copies where redistribution is permitted. Original source URLs remain only as provenance. Do not remove bundled LICENSE/README files from third-party packs.

## Unverified workplace artwork — separate audit

Start at `catalog/workplace-art-unverified-2026-10-05/README.md`, `search-manifest.json` and `archive-manifest.json`. This collection indexes 102,393 original paths across PNG icons, mixed clipart, EPS vectors and WMF/photo samples. Search gzip shards list pack, original path, category, format, dimensions and technical readiness. `raster-ready` is only a decoding/format classification, never a licence approval. Check archive storage status before assuming binaries exist in the repository. Do not represent these packs as licence-clear or apply this repository metadata licence to their artwork.

## Active cleaned artwork library

The [cleaned search gallery](catalog/game-art-search-v2-2026-10-05/README.md) is the active index for the four user-supplied archives. Unreadable, empty and unconvertible sources are excluded from its searchable records and cleaned PNG/JPEG packs. Use `catalog/user-artwork-active-library.json` for machine discovery. JSON/JSONL, SQLite, CSV and natural-language search are available in the [cleaned release](https://github.com/atiffhussainkhan/Image/releases/tag/game-art-search-v2-2026-10-05). Original archives remain historical backups; licences remain unverified.
